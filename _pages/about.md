I'm a Professor of Machine Learning (Tenured Associate Professor) at the Department of Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/)), and adjunct faculty at Rice University, where I was an assistant professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rice.edu/) from 2017-2019. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), and before that a researcher at [IBM Research Zurich](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/zurich/). I completed my PhD in 2014 at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/) and was a visiting PhD student at [Stanfords Universityâ€™s](https://www.stanford.edu/) Statistics Department. 

My work is centered on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information processing. I focus on developing algorithms and foundations for deep learning, particularly for medical imaging, on establishing mathematical and empirical underpinnings for machine learning, and on the utilization of DNA as a digital information technology.
