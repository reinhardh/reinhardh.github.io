I am a [Rudolf Moessbauer assistant professor](https://www.ias.tum.de/en/active-fellows/heckel-reinhard/) in [ECE](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/welcome/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/), and an adjunct assistant professor in [ECE](https://www.ece.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/), where I was an assistant professor from 2017-2019. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in [EE and CS](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), and a researcher at [IBM Research, Zurich](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/zurich/). I completed my PhD in electrical engineering in 2014 at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/) and was a visiting PhD student at the Statistics Department at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).

I work in the intersection of machine learning and signal/information processing with a current focus on deep networks for solving inverse problems, learning from few and noisy samples, and DNA data storage.
